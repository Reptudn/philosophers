# Philosopers
Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

## To-Do
- [ ] confirm that the fork taking is working correctly
- [ ] end all threads and close program after one philo has died
- [ ] check for memory safety with `valgrind --tool=helgrind`

## Input
- number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
- time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
- time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
- time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
- number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

## Tests
### Mandatory
- [x] Test: 1 800 200 200. The philosopher should not eat and should die.
- [x] Test: 5 800 200 200. No philosopher should die.
- [x] Test: 5 800 200 200 7. No philosopher should die and the simulation should stop when every philosopher has eaten at least 7 times.
- [x] Test: 4 410 200 200. No philosopher should die.
- [ ] Test: 4 310 200 100. One philosopher should die.

### Bonus
- Test: 5 800 200 200. No philosopher should die.
- Test: 5 800 200 200 7. No philosopher should die and the simulation should stop when every philosopher has eaten at least 7 times.
- Test: 4 410 200 200. No philosopher should die.
- Test: 4 310 200 100. One philosopher should die.
